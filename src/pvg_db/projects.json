Physics-based natural world creation is challenging because it requires a holistic interpretation of scenes and objects within it, including but not limited to appearance, geometry, materials, occlusion, motion, gravity, interaction, mass and sound.",

In general, such a few input views do not contain sufficient information for compressive 3D synthesis. However, our scientific hypothesis is that 3D synthesis from limited views is still possible by learning, from billion images, the capability of hallucinating unobserved parts of 3D objects/scenes, thus obtaining plausible if not faithful reconstructions.",
