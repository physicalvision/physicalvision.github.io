            "shortName": "SYN3D",
            "description": "The aim of SYN3D is to enable the effortless creation of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from limited views (from 0 to 5) in a feed-forward manner. In general, such a few input views do not contain sufficient information for compressive 3D synthesis. However, our scientific hypothesis is that 3D synthesis from limited views is still possible by learning, from billion images, the capability of hallucinating unobserved parts of 3D objects/scenes, thus obtaining plausible if not faithful reconstructions.",
